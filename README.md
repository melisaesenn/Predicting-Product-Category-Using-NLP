# Predicting Product-Category Using-Natural Language Processing
In this project, using the Flipkart Products data set, we will make a category prediction with the product descriptions in this data set. We will process the product descriptions in the data set through natural language processing and then make predictions with machine learning techniques.

The aim of this project is to compare the accuracy scores of the machine learning algorithms who weâ€™re going to train with the descriptions we pass through the natural language processing.
